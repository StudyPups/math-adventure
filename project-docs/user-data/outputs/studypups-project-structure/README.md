### When Making Big Decisions

**Before deciding on features, architecture, or approach:**

1. Check `planning/game-design-decisions.md` (what have you already decided?)
2. Think through WHY (what problem does this solve for Loli?)
3. Consider alternatives (what else could work?)
4. Make decision
5. **DOCUMENT IT** in game-design-decisions.md
6. Update current-sprint.md with implementation tasks

### After Playtesting with Loli

**Immediately after each session:**

1. Open `testing/loli-feedback-log.md`

5. Add nice-to-haves to game-design-decisions.md questions tracker

### When Preparing to Pitch

**Month 5-6, or when approaching partners:**

1. Update `business/pitch-vision-v1.md` with latest data

2. Open `planning/current-sprint.md`

**Reference:** These documentation files  
**Ask things like:**
- "I updated loli-feedback-log.md with today's session. What should I prioritize fixing?"
- "Looking at game-design-decisions.md, does my gem economy make sense?"

## 📤 Uploading to Claude Projects

**To make these files available in your Claude Project:**

1. Go to your StudyPups Project in Claude
2. Click "Add content" or "Project knowledge"
3. Upload these files (they're in `/home/claude/studypups-project-structure/`)
4. Claude will remember them across all conversations!

**Recommended uploads:**

- Your question bank (when created)
- Screenshots/sketches (when you have them)

## 🎨 Customizing This Structure

**This structure is a starting point!** As you work, you'll discover:
- Files you use constantly (keep them, refine them)
- Files you never open (archive or delete them)
- Missing files you wish existed (create them!)

**That's totally fine.** The structure serves you, not the other way around.

**Suggested additions as you grow:**
- `daily-log.md` (if you like journaling your progress)
- `questions-to-research.md` (parking lot for curiosities)
- `inspiration.md` (cool things you see in other games)
- `quotes-from-loli.md` (dedicated collection of her best lines)

---

## 🌟 Why This Matters

**You're building two things:**

1. **The game itself** (code, art, questions)
2. **The documentation** (decisions, learnings, evidence)

**The documentation is just as important as the code because:**
- You'll forget why you made decisions (3 months from now, you'll be grateful for notes)
- Partners/investors want to see clear thinking (documentation proves it)
- When you get stuck, past-you has answers (if you wrote them down)
- Loli's authentic reactions are GOLD (capture them fresh or lose them forever)

**This structure is your safety net.** Use it, trust it, update it.

---

## 🆘 Questions About This Structure?

**Ask Claude in your Projects chat:**
- "Which file should I update when X happens?"
- "I don't understand how to use Y file..."
- "Can you help me create a new file for Z?"
- "This feels overwhelming, what's the minimum I actually need?"
