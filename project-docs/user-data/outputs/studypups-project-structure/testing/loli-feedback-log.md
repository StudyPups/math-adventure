## Testing Protocol

### Before Each Session:
- [ ] Note what you're testing (new feature, bug fix, full playthrough)
- [ ] Prepare to observe without interfering (let her discover)
- [ ] Have notebook/phone ready for quotes
- [ ] Note time started

### During Session:
- [ ] Watch where she gets stuck
- [ ] Listen to what she says out loud
- [ ] Note when she asks for help vs. figures it out
- [ ] Observe body language (engaged = leaning in, bored = fidgeting)
- [ ] Track hint usage

### After Session:
- [ ] Ask: "What was fun? What was boring?"
- [ ] Ask: "What was too hard? Too easy?"
- [ ] Ask: "Would you play again?"
- [ ] Note time ended
- [ ] Document immediately (while memory fresh!)
