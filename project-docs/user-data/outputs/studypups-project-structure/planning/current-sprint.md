## 💡 AI Prompt for Converting Her Drawings:

**For Claude/ChatGPT with image upload:**
```
I have a drawing from a 10-year-old of a dog toy ball. 
Please convert this into a cute, colorful game asset suitable 
for a cartoon dog character. 

Keep the original colors and style the child used, but make 
it more polished and game-ready. Add subtle shading and 
highlights. Transparent background, PNG format.

Style: Cute, friendly, educational game aesthetic (think 
Animal Crossing or Webkinz).
```

**For Midjourney/DALL-E:**
```
/imagine cute cartoon dog toy ball, child's drawing style, 
colorful, simple shapes, game asset, transparent background, 
friendly educational game aesthetic --v 6

**Success = Loli can:**
- Answer questions and see gems increase
- Open shop and browse items
- Buy something and see she owns it

## 🎁 PHASE 1B: BONUS CONTENT (Optional - Month 5-6)

### If Time/Energy Allows: Port Café Game

**What:** Adapt existing café game (Levels 3-4) into StudyPups Restaurant location

**Why it's feasible:**
- Code already exists and works
- Lollie already loves it
- Hint system is perfect (copy-paste!)
- Math question structure fits StudyPups
- Progressive difficulty already built

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 weeks

**When to decide:** End of Month 4 checkpoint

**Criteria to port café:**
✅ Sheep Herding is demo-quality
✅ You have energy for 2-3 more weeks of building
✅ Would significantly improve pitch
✅ Can reuse café content easily

**What NOT to build yet:**
- ❌ Other farm jobs (Magic Beans, Dairy, etc.)
- ❌ Multiple difficulty modes
- ❌ Teacher dashboard
- ❌ Social features

---

## 📅 MONTH-BY-MONTH ROADMAP

- [ ] Learn JavaScript fundamentals
- [ ] Build game navigation (screens, buttons, transitions)
- [ ] Build question system (ask, check answer, feedback)
- [ ] Create tutorial (5 pattern questions)
- [ ] Test tutorial with Lollie

**Milestone:** Lollie can complete tutorial, asks "what's next?"

**Decision checkpoint:** 
- How hard was it to build?
- Does Lollie engage with it?
- Adjust timeline if needed

---

### Month 3-4: Sheep Herding + StudyPup System
**Goal:** Build first complete job + unlock system

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Design 10 sheep herding fraction questions
- [ ] Build Farm location screen
- [ ] Create sheep/pen visuals (AI art or placeholders)
- [ ] Implement sheep herding gameplay
- [ ] Build StudyPup unlock system
- [ ] Create Kelpie character
- [ ] Build Puppy Home screen
- [ ] Test with Lollie extensively

**Milestone:** Lollie unlocks Kelpie, wants to play again

**Decision checkpoint:**
- Does the core loop work? (job → gems → unlock → customize)
- Is code structure solid enough to add more?
- How's your energy level?

---

### Month 5: Shop + Notice Board + Polish
**Goal:** Complete the vertical slice

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Build shop system (5 items)
- [ ] Build Puppy Home customization (see items on pups)
- [ ] Build Notice Board (future content showcase)
- [ ] Design completion certificate
- [ ] Polish visuals throughout
- [ ] Fix all bugs
- [ ] Test with Lollie + 2-3 other kids
- [ ] Gather feedback

**Milestone:** Complete vertical slice ready to demo

**DECISION CHECKPOINT (End of Month 5):**

Ask yourself these questions:
1. Is Sheep Herding demo-quality? (If NO → spend Month 6 polishing)
2. Do I have energy for 2-3 more weeks? (If NO → stop here, start pitching)
3. Would Café significantly improve pitch? (If NO → not worth the effort)
4. Can I port café content easily? (If NO → too complex, skip it)

**If ALL answers are YES → Build Café in Month 6**
**If ANY answer is NO → Skip café, start pitch prep**

---

### Month 6: Option A (Polish) OR Option B (Add Café)

**OPTION A: Polish & Pitch Prep**
- [ ] More playtesting (Lollie + friends)
- [ ] Fix remaining bugs
- [ ] Add sound effects
- [ ] Improve visuals
- [ ] Write pitch deck
- [ ] Record demo video
- [ ] Contact math teacher friend
- [ ] Prepare for partnerships

**OPTION B: Port Café Content**
- [ ] Copy café code into StudyPups structure
- [ ] Replace café theme with restaurant theme
- [ ] Swap customer characters for StudyPups characters
- [ ] Add gem rewards (café just uses score)
- [ ] Integrate with StudyPup unlock (which pup?)
- [ ] Test adapted content
- [ ] Quick polish
- [ ] Write pitch deck with 2 locations

---

## 📊 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Minimum Success (Sheep Only):
**What you can pitch:**
> "StudyPups teaches Year 6 fractions through sheep herding at Farmer Buttercup's farm. Students unlock Kelpie, a fraction-specialist StudyPup. The system is designed to scale - we're adding 5+ more locations."

**What you demo:**
- 15 min gameplay
- Tutorial → Sheep → Unlock → Shop
- Notice board shows expansion plan

**Investment ask:**
"$50K to build 5 more locations + teacher features"

### Maximum Success (Sheep + Café):
**What you can pitch:**
> "StudyPups teaches Year 6 math across engaging locations. Students master fractions at the farm, then apply skills at the café/restaurant handling money and decimals. Each location unlocks specialist StudyPups."

**What you demo:**
- 25-30 min gameplay
- Two complete locations
- Transfer learning demonstrated
- Multiple StudyPup unlocks

**Investment ask:**
"$50K to complete remaining 4 locations + teacher dashboard"

**Both are strong. Second is stronger, but only if you can build it without burning out.**
