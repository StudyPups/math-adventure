## 💡 Power User Tips

### Use Search
Most text editors let you search across files:
- VS Code: Ctrl+Shift+F (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+F (Mac)
- Search for keywords across all docs!

### Link Between Files
When one file references another:
"See `planning/game-design-decisions.md` for gem economy rationale"

### Version Control
Consider adding these to your GitHub repo:
- Track changes over time
- Never lose documentation
- Share with collaborators

### Regular Reviews
Monthly: Re-read pitch-vision-v1.md (are you still aligned with your vision?)
Quarterly: Read everything (spot patterns, celebrate progress)

## 🆘 Feeling Lost?

**Try this sequence:**

1. Read `README.md` (orient yourself to structure)
2. Open `planning/current-sprint.md` (what should I do today?)
3. Check "WINS TO CELEBRATE" (remember progress!)
4. Pick ONE task (smallest possible version)
5. Do it
6. Update documentation
7. Repeat

**Still stuck?** Ask Claude in Projects chat:
"I'm feeling overwhelmed. Can you help me figure out what to focus on based on my current-sprint.md?"
