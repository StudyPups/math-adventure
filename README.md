# 🐾 StudyPups: Math Adventure

StudyPups is a child-friendly, story-based math learning game designed to make practice feel like an adventure instead of a worksheet.

This project is being built step-by-step as a learning journey, with a focus on:
- Engagement through story and characters
- Gentle guidance and encouragement
- Curriculum-aligned math practice (starting with patterns)

🌈 Built with love for my daughter — and potentially for other kids too.

## 🌱 Philosophy

This project prioritizes:
- Emotional safety while learning
- Curiosity over pressure
- Confidence-building through play

Mistakes are part of the game — and part of the build.

## 🧠 Notes to Future Me

- Don’t rush folder structure — working code first
- Backups are okay while learning
- One magical scene at a time is enough
