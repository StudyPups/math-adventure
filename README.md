## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Built with guidance from Claude (Anthropic) and inspiration from:
- Every parent who's watched homework become a nightly battle
- Every kid who thinks they're "bad at math" (you're not!)
- Every teacher who goes the extra mile for students who learn differently

---

**Made with 💜 for kids who need math to feel like an adventure, not a chore.**
